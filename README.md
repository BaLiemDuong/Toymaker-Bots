Toymaker Bots project
is assignment 2 for Industrial Robotics at UTS Spring Semester

The project purpose is to learn robotics control through matlab, a vital skill for mechatroncics engineeers.
Specifically, we will be working with robot arms available at UTS and also simulate our own on matlab.

What we will do in this project
Use matlab to simulate 2 robot arms working together to assemble a toy car from pre-made parts delivered using conveyor belts. The conveyor belts will be positioned on 2 sides of the robots, providing parts, the arms will be placed on a table in the middle and will assemble the car between them. Protective barriers as well as e-stop and fire extinguisher will be installed on the premise. Hans Cute robot arm have been chosen from models provided by UTS and a 7-link robot will be made from scratch. If the simulation is successful, the code will be uploaded to a real robot and tested.
